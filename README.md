# PyTorch Implementation of ResUnet++âœ¨

## Abstract
Accurate computer-aided polyp detection and segmentation during colonoscopy examinations can help endoscopists resect abnormal tissue and thereby decrease chances of polyps growing into cancer. Towards developing a fully automated model for pixel-wise polyp segmentation, we propose ResUNet++, which is an improved ResUNet architecture for colonoscopic image segmentation. Our experimental evaluations show that the suggested architecture produces good segmentation results on publicly available datasets. Furthermore, ResUNet++ significantly outperforms U-Net and ResUNet, two key state-ofthe-art deep learning architectures, by achieving high evaluation scores with a dice coefficient of 81.33%, and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 79.27% for the Kvasir-SEG dataset and a dice coefficient of 79.55%, and a mIoU of 79.62% with CVC-612 dataset.

</p>

ResUnet++ architecture is based on the Deep Residual U-Net, which is an architecture that uses the strength of deep residual learning and U-Net. The Proposed ResUnet++ architecture take advantage of the residual blocks, the squeeze and excitation block, ASPP and the attention block.

## Model Short Explanation
* Residual Units  
Training a deep neural network with an increasing depth can improve accuracy. However, it can hamper training process and cause degradation problem. To address this problem, ResUnet uses full pre-activation residual units that helps to propagate information using skip connections, improving the design of the neural network.

* Squeeze and Excitation Units (SE)  
Squeeze and Excitation network boosts the representative power of the network by re-calibrating the features responses employing precise modeling inter-dependencies between the channels. The goal of the squeeze and excite block is to ensure that the network can increase its sensitivy to the relevant features and suppress the unnecessary features.

* Astrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP)  
In ASPP, the contextual information is captured at various scales, and many parallel astrous convolutions with different rates in the input feature map are fused. In the proposed architecutre, ASPP acts acts a bridge between encoder and decoder.

* Attention Units  
The attention mechanism is mostly popular in NLP task. It gives attention to the subset of its input. The attention mechanism determines which parts of the network require more attention in the neural network. The main advantage of the attention mechanism is that they are simple, can be applied to any input size, enhance the quality of features that boosts the results.
